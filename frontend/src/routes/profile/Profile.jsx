    question: "What is the significance of meditation in Buddhist practice?",
    answer:
      "In Buddhism, meditation (bhƒÅvanƒÅ) is not merely about stress reduction but is a core practice for developing wisdom and compassion. There are two main types: Samatha (concentration) which calms the mind, and Vipassana (insight) which develops clear seeing into the nature of reality. Unlike secular mindfulness, Buddhist meditation is part of the Noble Eightfold Path, specifically Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. The ultimate aim is to see the three characteristics of existence: impermanence (anicca), unsatisfactoriness (dukkha), and non-self (anatta), which leads to Nibbana (liberation).",

    question: "How does Theravada Buddhism differ from Mahayana Buddhism?",
    answer:
      "Theravada Buddhism focuses on the individual's path to liberation through becoming an arahant, while Mahayana emphasizes the bodhisattva ideal of helping all beings attain liberation. Theravada adheres closely to the Pali Canon as its primary scripture, considering it to contain the original teachings of the Buddha, while Mahayana includes additional sutras. Regarding practice, Theravada emphasizes meditation and monastic discipline as the primary path, while Mahayana encompasses a wider range of practices including visualization, mantra recitation, and devotional practices.",

    question: "What is the Buddhist perspective on suffering?",
    answer:
      'In Buddhism, suffering (dukkha) is the first of the Four Noble Truths taught by the Buddha. The term dukkha encompasses a broader meaning than the English word "suffering" - it includes dissatisfaction, stress, and the inherent unsatisfactoriness of conditioned existence. The Buddha taught that suffering arises from craving (tanha) and ignorance (avijja) about the true nature of reality. By understanding the causes of suffering through wisdom and mindfulness, we can follow the Eightfold Path to its cessation, leading to Nibbana.',
